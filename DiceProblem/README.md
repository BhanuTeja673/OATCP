Input:

The algorithm takes input from a file named "input.txt", which contains the number of test cases and the target sums for each test case.
Initialization:

For each test case, the algorithm initializes a memoization vector memo of size target + 1 with all elements set to -1. This vector is used to store the number of ways to reach each possible sum.
Recursive Function - countWays:

The countWays function calculates the number of ways to reach a target sum starting from a given sum, using a dice with faces numbered 1 to 6.
Base Case: If the target sum is reached (target == sum), it returns 1.
Memoization: If the number of ways to reach the current sum has already been computed, it returns the stored result from memo.
Recursive Step: It iterates over each face of the dice (1 to 6) and recursively calls countWays with the updated sum. If the updated sum is less than or equal to the target, it adds the result of the recursive call to the total ways.
Finally, it stores the result in the memo vector and returns it.
Main Loop:

The main loop reads each test case's target sum from standard input and calculates the number of ways to reach that sum using the countWays function.
If the target sum is greater than 0, it prints the result to standard output. Otherwise, it prints 0 directly.
Output:

The algorithm writes the results for each test case to a file named "../output/output.txt".
Complexity:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the number of possible sums and the depth of the recursion. It can be optimized using memoization, resulting in a time complexity of O(target * 6), where target is the maximum target sum.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(target) due to the memoization vector.
