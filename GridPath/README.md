Input:

The algorithm reads the number of test cases t and for each test case, it reads the size of the grid n and the grid itself from a file named "input2.txt".
Function Definition:

ll f(int i, int j, vector<vector<char>>& grid, int n,vector<vector<int>> &dp): This recursive function calculates the number of paths from cell (i, j) to the bottom-right corner of the grid. It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
Base Cases:
If the current cell (i, j) is out of the grid boundaries or it contains an obstacle '*', it returns 0.
If the current cell (i, j) is the bottom-right corner of the grid, it returns 1.
If the result for cell (i, j) has already been computed and stored in the dp table, it returns the stored result.
Recursive Step:
It recursively explores two possible moves: moving right (i, j + 1) and moving down (i + 1, j).
It sums up the results of these recursive calls (number of paths moving right and number of paths moving down), taking modulo mod.
It stores the result in the dp table to avoid redundant computations.
Main Function:

Reads the number of test cases t.
For each test case:
Reads the size of the grid n.
Initializes a grid of size n x n and a memoization table dp of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements set to -1.
Reads the grid elements from input.
Calls the function f with initial parameters (0, 0) (starting from the top-left corner of the grid).
Prints the result to standard output.
Output:

The algorithm writes the results for each test case to a file named "../output/output2.txt".
Complexity:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the size of the grid n. The memoization technique ensures that each cell in the grid is visited at most once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the memoization table dp and the grid.
